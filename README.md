How do I approach designing software?
  - During this course, I developed very good foundational skills for creating computer graphics and applying these skills in a meaningful way. I took an iterative approach to every project in this course, to ensure that I wrapped up a concept before trying to incorporate any more advanced features. I felt like this approach allowed me to develop a stronger understanding of computer graphics and visualization, so that I could apply these skills in a real-world scenario. 
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  - As stated in the previous question, iteration was a key component in my development of assignments and my final project in this course. Being able to add just a little more to my project image throughout each module really helped to understand how each component of the image interacted with each other.
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - This course presented me with knowledge in an area that I had very little knowledge in. Most of this work was relatively foreign to me before this course, so it was a great learning experience to get exposure to something well outside of my comfort zone. I think that the work done in this course will provide another avenue for me to develop personal projects and to have something else to work on, even if I decide to not pursue computer graphics in my professional career.
